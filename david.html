The preamplifier outputs were transported 20 metres via SCSI-5 cables to the same model of TIG10 modules as used for digitizing tigress signals [8]. Further details concerning sharc may be found in ref. [1].

2.2. Tigress
Tigress, the Triumf-Isac Gamma-Ray Escape-Suppressed Spectrometer, is a Hyper-Pure Germanium (HPGe) array. It consists of up to sixteen HPGe detectors that can be mounted in rings orientated at θ = 45◦, 90◦ and 135◦ around the target. The sharc target chamber excludes access to the 45◦ positions, so the eight detectors available at the time of the experiment were mounted with four in each of the other rings. Each clover consists of four individual closed-ended coaxial HPGe crystals which are packed into a common cryostat, with tapering at the front of the crystal to allow for close packing. The crystals are n-type and have approximately 40 % relative efficiency. Each clover has 32-fold segmentation: each of its four crystals has four quadrants and there is a lateral segmentation at z = 31 mm, where z = 0 corresponds to the front of the crystal. The four rear segments in each clover reduce the uncertainty in the angle of emission of the γ-ray, by providing 3D localisation [9]. Each clover in the Tigress array is flanked by four Bismuth-Germanate shields, all of which were mounted for this experiment. Coupled with a CsI(Tl) plug behind the clover, the suppression shields have twenty-fold segmentation [4] to allow for full Compton suppression. Titanium collimators are attached to the front of the clovers, to prevent any gamma rays directly striking the BGO shields. The front face of the clovers were 14 cm from the target.

2.3. Trifoil
Downstream of sharc and tigress, an in-beam zero degree detector was mounted at a distance of 40cm from the target. Whereas in previous experiments a spectrometer was employed at zero degrees [6], this was not available at isac-ii and a simpler solution was required in order to distinguish between transfer reaction recoils and other products. Specifically, fusion- evaporation reactions induced on the carbon component of the target were expected to produce a significant and relatively isotropic background of light charged particles (mainly protons). The corresponding compound nuclei were typically slower moving and of higher Z than the beam and hence the (d,p) reaction products. An aluminium stopping foil was inserted in the beam path, with the thickness of 30 μm chosen to be just sufficient to stop the evaporation nuclei. The beam particles and the reaction products retained sufficient energy to pass easily through the thin plastic scintillator of the trifoil detector and be transported to a shielded beam dump at a distance of ∼ 2 metres.

The trifoil detector is so named because it utilises three photomultiplier tubes, as shown in Fig. 2. The active area consists of a 10 μm thick BC400 plastic scintillator foil, with an active area 40 × 40 mm, mounted in a plexiglass frame that acts as a light guide. The foil thickness is optimised for good light output for the ions and energies considered here whilst inducing the minimum possible multiple scattering. For the trifoil to trigger, at least two of the three photomultiplier tubes need to fire in coincidence. This allows the individual thresholds to be set at a level comparable with the noise, which is required for very low optical yield of such a thin scintillator foil.

The kinematics of the ejected protons were calculated, and it was found that the trifoil could be mounted 40 cm behind the target and still span the entire cone of the reaction products for protons recorded backwards of 90◦. The trifoil was exposed to all beam particles, as the beam was transmitted through it before being incident upon the beam dump. The aluminium foil stopped the fusion-evaporation products, as discussed above. The alternative was to rely upon the timing of the trifoil signal relative to the RF signal from isac-ii to be able to distinguish</textarea>
